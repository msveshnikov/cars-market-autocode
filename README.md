## Design Considerations

1. Implement a modular component structure for better code organization and reusability
2. Use React hooks and context API for state management
3. Implement a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
4. Use containerization with Docker for easier deployment and scaling
5. Implement rate limiting and security measures to prevent abuse
6. Implement A/B testing for UI/UX improvements
7. Use performance monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time insights

## Monitoring and Analytics

-   Utilize Prometheus for metrics collection and monitoring
-   Implement Grafana dashboards for visualizing application performance and user behavior
-   Set up logging and error tracking systems for better debugging and issue resolution

## TODO

-   Add car images (from Google search by model)
-   Improve overall design and user experience
-   Implement responsive design for mobile devices
-   Set up Docker containers for development and production environments
-   Implement user authentication and authorization system
